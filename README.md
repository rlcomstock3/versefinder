# versefinder
A scripture verse finder

Using the text scriptures found at

https://github.com/beandog/lds-scriptures

This will parse all of the scripture text file and create a map to then fuzzy search for the reference.
It can take arguments such as Moroni 10:3-5 and it will only display the verses requested.  There is 
minimal error checking, but it is simple and robust.
